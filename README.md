# Arduino---Wild-Lock
My first Arduino repository.

The game is simple. We have :

- A button press to restart the game
- A rotative button like in the films for opening a safe (treasure)
- A LED which brights when you win a step
- A screen that displays if you are cold or hot

When turning the rotative button, you will come across "hot" in the screen while being in "cold" before. Try to turn the button smoothly and to go in the "middle" of hot to find the good combination.

When you succeed, the LED will bright and the "hot point" will randomly restart anew from other angle. Restart the manoeuver two times and you will win the game !

When the LED brights three times you have won, and the screen will display how many time you took for finishing the game, that's all.

You can restart randomly the game by pressing the push button.

Good Luck, Wild Lock ;)
